# Hey, I’m Bushra

I'm a **Software Engineer**. Fan of nextjs and tailwindcss. love to write javascript code and create new technologies. 
For the past two years, I’ve been building applications, especially in frontend development. I love creating visually appealing, responsive, and interactive user interfaces. Writing clean, structured, and maintainable code is something I care deeply about, and I’m always working to improve.

When I’m not coding, I read non-fiction books and spend time on my phone exploring tech content and new ideas. I’m always curious and love learning something new.
